Hello, welcome to my second video on the Rust programming language! In the last video, we covered installing Rust and creating a "Hello, World!" program. In this video, we'll take a look at a tool called Cargo and also learn about variables in Rust. Now in our last video, when we made the hello world program, we did everything manually. First we created a file using the touch command, next we wrote our rust code in the file using a text editor, then compiled it using the rust compiler and finally executed the resulting binary. But thats not how we do it in reality. Instead we will use a tool called cargo.

Whats Cargo? Well Cargo is the official Rust build tool and package manager. Its a very useful tool that helps us create projects, manage dependencies, compile projects and also distribute them. It automatically compilies and links all the various dependencies in our program and also helps us run and test them easily.

Now lets see how we can use cargo. The first thing we need to do is to create a new project using cargo. To do that, we can use "cargo new". This command prompts Cargo to create a new project, which is specified by the new subcommand. We also need to provide the name of the project at the end of the command. I will call it hello_world. Once Cargo finishes creating the project, we have to navigate into our newly created project directory using the cd command. Type cd and then the name of the project we just created, which in my case is hello_world. Then we can run the project using cargo run. Cargo compiles our project and then executes the resulting binary, which in turn, displays "hello world" in the terminal. It gives this output because when we create a new project, Cargo automatically generates a main.rs file and includes some boilerplate code as a starting point. By default, a project created using cargo will have this directory structure. Here we can see that there are two files in the root directory, namely Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock and also an src subdirectory. Further inside the src directory, there is main.rs file. This file is the entry point of our program. Without it our program will fail to compile. I will explain the other two files in the root directory some time later.

Okay, so now that we know how to create and run rust projects using cargo, lets move on to the rust syntax. The first thing we will learn is variables. We will see how we can create them, set their value and also how we can mutate or modify them.

First lets see how we can create, or rather define a variable. To define a variable we need to use the `let` keyword. Every variable has an identifier, which is commonly referred to as the variable name. So when we use the `let` keyword to create a variable, we need to provide a name for the variable as well. I'll call this variable x. Now we defined a variable named x but currently, it does have a value. We can fix this by initializing this variable to a value, lets say 0. So what this will do is, it'll create a variable named x and initialize it to 0.

Now we have created a variable, but it actually doesn't do anything yet. So what we are going to do is print out this variable to the standard output. We can print it out using the println! macro, which i talked about in the last video. But there are some slight differences compared to what we did last time. Last time, we just entered the string we wanted to print inside the double quotes. That works for strings, but not quite for variables. If we want to print variables, we need to "format" the string. Now formatting strings in rust is pretty similar to whats done in other languages like Python. To format our string, add a pair of curly braces, inside the double quotes. Next we need to pass in what variable we want to print as a second argument to the println macro. Put a comma next to the quotes and then type in x, the name of our variable. This is the basics of formatting strings. There are a lot more stuff we can do, but I'll talk about them later. If we now run our project, it should print `0` in the terminal, which is currently, our standard output. 

Okay. So now we can declare a variable, and also set its value. But it would be great if we could change it, right? That seems easy, just put `x = 1;` after we declare the variable, right? Well not quite. If we now try running the code, it won't compile and will give this error.

This error occurs because any variable in Rust is **immutable** by default, meaning that they are constant and they're value cannot be changed after they've been assigned. If we want to change the value of this variable, i.e, **mutate** the variable, then we need to tell the compiler that this variable is mutable. To do that we can use the `mut` keyword. So to make the `x` variable mutable, put `mut` after the `let` keyword, like so. Now that x is mutable, we can change its value, or rather mutate it. Lets try running our code again. It should work this time and it'll print `1` to the terminal.

Now that we understand the concept of mutation, lets look at another scenario. Sometimes we don't know what value to initialize the variable to or we don't want to initialize it to a default value. Thats simple enough, just dont initialize it to a value, right? Well not quite. As I said in my previous video, Rust has a very strict type system, meaning you can't just define a variable like you could in Python. You need to tell the Rust compiler what type of variable you want it to be. But then, you might ask, *"but we didn't set any specific type when we declared `x` the first time, did we?"*, and you'd be partially right. 

Yes, we didn't set a hard coded type, but since we initialized it to a value, i.e, `0` the Rust compiler inferred the type to be an integer. When we removed the initial value, the Rust compiler doesn't know the type of the `x` variable. It could be an integer, a float, a boolean or even a string. In other words, it could be *anything*! And the rust compiler will not allow us to create a variable if its type is unknown, since it affects the integrity of our program. That's why we need to specify the type when we create any variable. Some basic types you should know in Rust are integers, floats, strings, booleans and vectors.

First lets talk about integers. Integers represent any number without a floating point, also known as a decimal point. In Rust, there are two primary categories of integers: ***signed*** and ***unsigned***. ***Signed*** integers can represent both positive and negative numbers, whereas ***unsigned*** integers can only represent non-negative numbers. These integer types come in various sizes, measured in **bits**. This basically defines the highest and lowest numbers the variable can hold. `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, etc... are for signed integers, and `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, etc... are for unsigned integers.

Next, lets look at floats. Floats are used for representing decimal values. So whatever number you can't represent as an integer, you can represent as a float. Similar to integers, floats also come in sizes, but theres a key difference. In the case of integers, the sizes represent the maximum and minimum values the variable can hold. On the other hand, in the case of floats, these sizes determine the precision of the float. There are two sizes of floats currently available, `f32` and `fThese different sizes help us handle different levels of precision, where `f32` is a 32-bit floating-point number and `f64` is a 64-bit floating-point number.

3. **Strings**: There are two types of strings in Rust, `String` and `&str`. `String` is a dynamic and mutable data type used to store sequences of characters. It can grow or shrink as needed, allowing you to modify its content by adding or removing characters. On the other hand, `&str` represents a string slice, essentially a reference to a sequence of characters, often stored in another data structure like a `String` or a static string. Unlike `String`, `&str` is static and immutable, primarily used for reading and processing text without altering the original data. So, `String` is for flexible, mutable text, while `&str` is for efficient and unchanging text references.

4. **Booleans**: Booleans are one of the primitive types that are found in any language. A boolean represents either ***`true`*** or ***`false`***. In Rust, booleans have the `bool` type.

5. **Vectors**: Vectors in Rust are akin to **arrays** in other programming languages. A vector is a dynamic data structure capable of storing a list of elements of the same type, such as a vector of integers or a vector of strings. They are declared using the `Vec` keyword. For instance, to create a vector of integers, you can write `Vec<i32>`, which generates a vector containing 32-bit signed integers. Vectors are mutable, allowing you to add, remove, or modify values within them.
 

Now lets see how we can set the type of a variable. To set the type of a variable, put a colon next to the variable identifier, ie its name and then enter the type. I'll set the type of this variable to i32 which is a 32 bit signed integer.

If you modify our old code like this and then run it, it should compile without any errors. It'll also output 1 since we're printing this variable. We can also perform arithmetic operations on these variables. For example, lets initialize x to 16. Then lets set the value of x to x + 4. What this will do is it will fetch the previous value of x which is 16, add 4 to it and then set the value of x to this sum. So the output will be 20.

Now lets try subtraction. We can replace the plus with a minus sign like this. What this will do is it will fetch the value of x, subtract 4 from it and then set the value of x to difference. This will give us an output of 12.

We can also do operations with two variables. First lets remove the mut keyword from the line which defines the x variable, since its no longer necessary. Lets also remove the second line where we're mutating x.   Next lets define another variable named y and set it to 1024. We'll create one more variable called z to hold the output of the arithmetic operations. Lets set the value of z to y times x. To do that, type in y, then the modulus sign and then type in x. We also need to change the value we're printing from x to z. What this will do is it will multiply the value of y which is 1024 with the value of x which is 16. This is will output 16384.

In similar fashion, we can perform division. For division, replace the modulus sign with a slash sign. This will divide the value of y, i.e 1024 by 16 and set the value of z. The output of this will be 64.

aThat should be everything you need to know to get started with using variables in Rust. In the next section we'll look at functions.
