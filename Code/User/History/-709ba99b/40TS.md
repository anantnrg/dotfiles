Hi, welcome to my third video on the rust programming language. In the last video, we looked at Cargo and also learned about variables in Rust. In this video, we will take a look at a very interesting topic, functions. 

First of all, whats a function. A function is a reusable set of instructions designed to perform a specific task or operation within a program. A function is designed to receive inputs, which are also referred to as arguments or parameters. Once it has these inputs, the function carries out a specific task or computation based on these received values. Finally, after performing its operations, the function produces or returns the result or output.

Okay, now we know what functions are. Next lets see how we can create and use functions in Rust. We can define functions in Rust using the fn keyword. Now, similar to variables, functions too have unique identifiers. For example lets call this get_cuboid_volume. Now after the identifier, we need to put a pair of brackets. Then we also need to put a pair of curly braces. As you may have guessed from the name of the function, we need to find the volume of a cuboid. We will write the logic for our function inside these curly braces.

Now if you look at this closely, it might look a bit familiar. Thats because in the first video, I showed you how to create the main function. We know that the main function is the entry point of our program. Technically, we could just write all the code inside the main function. But if we do that, then our code will become cluttered and unreadable. It will also be harder to debug and modify. But if we use functions, we can separate different tasks in different functions. This will hugely improve the quality and readability of our code. Okay, lets get back to writing our function to find the volume of a cuboid.

We know that the volume of a cuboid is calculated by multiplying the length, breadth, and height of the cuboid together. Lets write this formula in Rust. First we will create 3 variables, l, w, and h and set them to the length, breadth and height of the cuboid. I'll set l to 128, b to 46 and h to 11. Then we will create a variable named volume and set it to the product of the length, breadth and height, like this. Now we've found the volume of a cuboid. Lets print it out using the println! macro. We will use what we learned in the last video and format the string. Now if we run our project, this wont actually do anything. Thats because even though we've defined this function, we haven't yet called it. To call this function, lets go back to the main function. Then to call this function, we first have to type in the function identifier, which in our case is get_cuboid_area. Next we need to put a pair of brackets, like this. Now we have called, or invoked our function in the main function. Next lets try running the project using Cargo run. It should print the volume of our cuboid in the terminal. 

Okay, so now we created a function that calculates and prints out the volume of a cuboid. But it isnt that useful, because if we want to change the dimensions of the cuboid then we need to always change the code inside this function. And if we want to get the volumes of multiple different cuboids, we need to make many different instances of this function and then change the values in each instance. Obviously, this isn't intuitive at all. But we can fix this, by calling this function and passing in the dimensions, which the function will use to calculate the volume. This way, we only need to have one function and we can call this function as many times as we want to get the volumes of different cuboids. 

To pass in the dimensions, we will define some arguments for the functions and then pass in these arguments when we call this function. To define the arguments, we have to type in each argument inside the brackets next to the function identifier. Each argument is separated by commas. We should remember the order of the arguments when we later call this function, because if we pass in the arguments in the wrong order, then the calculation could go wrong. So to define an argument, type in the name of the argument, for example l. Then we also need to define the type of the variable, because otherwise our program will not compile. I'll set the type to i32. Now we can repeat this for the remaining two arguments, b and h. 

Then we can delete these let statements which we used to define the dimension variables, since we are now passing the dimensions as arguments. Now lets go back to the main function and pass in the arguments when we call the function. Inside the brackets, we need to type our values, quite similar to how we defined the arguments, but instead of the argument name, we need to type the value. I'll pass in the length as 172, the breadth as 36 and the height as 8. Now lets go back to the terminal and run our project. It will output 49536, which is the volume of our cuboid.

Great, now we can call our function with different dimensions without changing the function itself. Next lets take a look another scenario. Currently, we take in the arguments, perform the calculations and then print out the result. But sometimes we want to get the result and do some more calculations on it. We can do that by returning the result. To return the output, we need to specify the output type. To specifiy the output type, put a dash and then a right angle bracket just before the starting curly brace, like this. then we need to specify the type. In our case, it'll be i32. Now this alone wont return the value. To actually return the value, we need to use the return keyword and then specify the variable we want to return. This will be the volume variable in our case.

Next we need to go back to the main function and instead of just calling this function, we'll create a variable to hold the return value, then put an equal sign and call our function. What this will do is it will
